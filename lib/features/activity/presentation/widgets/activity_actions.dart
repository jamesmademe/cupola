/// The write actions the Activity surfaces can perform on a queue or blocklist
/// record.
///
/// Activity was a read-only feed: it could tell you a download had stalled and
/// then offered no way to do anything about it, so the resolution path for every
/// problem it surfaced was to leave and open the service's web UI. These close
/// that loop.
///
/// Each one confirms first, neutrally, with a verb that says what will happen,
/// never in red, which means unreachable and nothing else. It reports the outcome, and bumps [activityRefreshVersionProvider] so every
/// bucket re-reads rather than leaving a removed row on screen.
///
/// ## Every write takes the connection it acts on
///
/// These used to resolve the service through the **lens**: whichever Radarr
/// the user last looked at. That was correct only while the feed showed one
/// server. Now that /activity merges every connection, the lens and the row are
/// different facts, and \*arr record ids are per server: each one numbers its
/// queue from one, so `id: 7` names a different download on each Sonarr.
/// Sending a removal to the lens would delete somebody else's download and
/// report success. So the caller passes the row's own `instanceId` and it
/// resolves through [connectionArrServiceProvider]; an empty id still means
/// "the lens", which is what the per-service Activity screen wants.
///
/// The same is true of the two request actions, for the same reason in Seerr's
/// vocabulary: a request id is per instance, so approving id 42 through the
/// lens approves a different person's request on a different server, and
/// reports success. They resolve through `seerrServiceForProvider`.
